The GOCM appraoch has been implimented. However, it is only reliable for the solid problem.
The sensitivty of the thermal problem contains positive values when this method is used. I am not sure how this can be as the according to the paper, when
	the matrix is SPD, the sensitivities should be negative. I will need to look into this further, but for now the original OCM approach works fine.

The main idea of the SIMP method is to penalise intermediate densities. However, there may be a solution with intermediate densities that are better than the 
	solutions with binary relative densities. intermediate densities are allowed when we use lattice structures. 
My reasoning for better solutions being possible is that when we impliment phase change, the thermal conductivity will allow more of the PCM to absorb energy at once.
	However, with the current approach, there will be a clear melt front which would limit how much energy can be absorbed per unit time. (at least if my reasoning is right)

In order to impliment more constraints, the derivatives of the constraints with respect to the relative density will need to be computed. These may be complicated and
	will most likely require numerical differentiation. This will become a very expensive operation. Therefore, AD should be implimented with more urgency than discussed in
	week 5's meeting.
